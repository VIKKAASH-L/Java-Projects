This repository serves as a comprehensive showcase of Java projects that highlight different programming skills, including GUI development, data structure manipulation, algorithm implementation, and database interaction. Each project is documented with code comments and includes a detailed explanation in its respective directory.

## Projects Overview

Here is a brief overview of the projects currently available in this repository:

- **Calculator Application (Java Swing)**: A basic calculator that performs arithmetic operations with a graphical user interface.
- **User Registration Form**: A form built using Swing that collects user information and stores it in a database using JDBC.
- **Tic Tac Toe Game**: An interactive Tic Tac Toe game using Java Swing for the GUI.
- **To-Do List Application**: A simple to-do list app for task management, featuring task addition, deletion, and completion status.
- **Bus Reservation System**: A complete system to manage bus seat reservations, with interactive forms and database integration.

   git clone https://github.com/VIKKAASH-L/Java-Projects.git
   cd Java-Projects
   ```

2. **Install Java and necessary tools**:
   Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or above installed. You may also need additional libraries depending on the project, such as:

   - **Swing** (for GUI projects)
   - **JDBC** and a database like MySQL or SQLite (for database-related projects)

3. **Open the project in your IDE**:
   Open any of the project folders in your preferred IDE, such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.

4. **Run the project**:
   Compile and run the main Java class to start the project.

## Project Structure
